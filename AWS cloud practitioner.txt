03 What is Cloud Computing?

    Examples of cloud computing types:
        - IaaS -> Amazon EC2, GCP, Digital Ocean
        - PaaS -> Elastic Bean Stack(AWS), Google App Engine
        - SaaS -> Rekognition for Machine learning on AWS, Dropbox, Zoom

    An AWS Region is a cluster of data centers
    A region has between 2 and 6 availability zones...each availability zone has redundant power, networking and
    connectivity..so they are isolated from disasters.

    AWS points of presence (edge locations) - these make content to be delivered to customers with lower latency

    Some services, like Route 53, IAM are Global...while other are regional (like EC2).
    NOT all AWS services are available in all the regions. You can see on their website if a specific service is available
    or not for a specific region.

!!!    Shared responsibility model
        This means that you as a developer are responsible for the security IN the cloud (customer data, app security,
        OS, firewall config, server side encryption etc) while AWS is responsible for the security OF the cloud...(the
        hardware, infrastructure, physical security)
            TODO Dan: question about this come in the exam


==============================================================================================================
04 IAM - Identity and Access Management

    We already used IAM when we created the root account. (also when I created accounts for the shopping app)

    Root account should not be used or shared...just to create other users

    Users can be grouped in a Group.
    Groups can only contain Users, not other Groups.
    A User can belong to multiple Groups

    Users and Groups can have json documents assigned which are called Policies

!!!!In AWS you apply the least privileged principle: don't give more permissions than the user needs.

    DanCurs     user created

    A Policy is a json document, that contains a version, and one or more Statements.
    The Statement element has several important parts:
        - effect : whether the Statement allows or denies access
        - principal : user/account/role for which the Statement applies
        - action : list of actions that are being allowed or denied
        - resource : list of resources to which the actions are applied

    Users on AWS console should use MFA (multi factor authentication)

    3 ways to connect to AWS:
        - AWS web console                       (protected by password and MFA)
        - AWS CLI (command line interface)      (PROTECTED by keys)
        - AWS SDK                               (PROTECTED by keys)

    Acess keys are generated from the AWS console.

    Installed AWS CLI on the machine :)
        "The AWS CLI first checks environment variables for credentials. If you've set the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables, those will be used for authentication. You can check your
        system's environment variables to see if they're set."
            Dan: because i used this setup, when i worked in the past on the shop app, for uploading S3 pictures,
            now when i follow the tutorial, i created an AWS CLI profile, called "dancurs"..which needs to be specified
            each time i run an AWS CLI command, otherwise it will use the env variable key, which only has S3 permissions

    Example:
        aws iam list-users --profile dancurs

    An alternative to AWS CLI is AWS cloud shell.
        "AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell that gives you command-line access to your AWS resources in the
        selected AWS region. AWS CloudShell comes pre-installed with popular tools for resource management and creation.
        You have the same credentials as you used to log in to the console"

        So since you are logged in the web console, no need to hassle with generating keys etc
    Example:
         aws iam list-users

    AWS Cloud shell offers space as well...so if you create files there etc...they will be "persisted"
        "Storage included 1 GB of storage free per AWS region"

    Some AWS services will need to perform actions on your behalf. To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS Services,
    with IAM Roles.
        Example if you start an EC2 instance (virtual server) and you want this to access some AWS service, like listing users,
        then you need to assign a role to EC2. They are also often used with Lambda.

    Auditing ..If you select a user and go to  the Access Advisor tab, you can see what AWS Services he accessed and when.
    This tool is very useful as if you notice that a user does not use some services, you can remove access for those services, and
    thus minimize the no of operations that he can perform.
    Similarly there is a Credentials Report, that lists all IAM users in your account, shows the status of access keys
    for each user, including:
    Access Key ID: The unique identifier for the access key. Status: Indicates whether the access key is active or inactive.
    Last Used Date: The date and time when the access key was last used for an API call (if applicable).

05 EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

    This is Infrastructure as a service offering from Amazon
    It mainly consists of:
        - Renting Virtual Machines (EC2)
        - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
        - Distributing Load across Machines (ELB)

    Sizing and configuration options :
        - operating system : linux, windows, macos
        - CPU
        - RAM
        - storage :
            - network attached (EBS)
            - hardware (ECS instance store)
        - network card
        - firewall rules
        - bootstrap script, configure at first launch

    Bootstrap script allows you to                  (this script runs with root acess)
        - install updates
        - install software
        - download files from the internet
        - anything else you might think about

            Example used in the course:  (this will launch a webserver and write a html file to it)
#!/bin/bash
# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html

!!!!!
    In order to make the EC2 accessible via ssh and from the outside world, check out the youtube tutorial from the end
    (" AWS how to setup VPC, Public, Private Subnet, NAT, Internet Gateway, Route Table?")
    and the diagram "AWS VPC Subnet InternetGateway RouteTable.png" to better understand the networking elements.

    EC2 instance types
    https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
        General Purpose
            General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources, and can be used
            for a variety of diverse workloads. These instances are ideal for applications that use these resources in
            equal proportions such as web servers and code repositories.
            Applications built on open-source software such as application servers, microservices, gaming servers,
            midsize data stores, and caching fleets.

        Compute Optimized
            Compute Optimized instances are ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance
            processors. Instances belonging to this category are well suited for batch processing workloads, media
            transcoding, high performance web servers, high performance computing (HPC), scientific modeling, dedicated
            gaming servers and ad server engines, machine learning inference and other compute intensive applications.

        Memory Optimized
            Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data
            sets in memory.

        Accelerated Computing
            Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform functions, such as
            floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, more efficiently than
            is possible in software running on CPUs.

        Storage Optimized
            Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access
            to very large data sets on local storage. They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency,
            random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications.
                Usecases:
                    SQL and NoSQL dbs
                    cache for in memory DB like Redis
                    data warehouse apps
                    distributed file systems

        HPC Optimized
            High performance computing (HPC) instances are purpose built to offer the best price performance for running
            HPC workloads at scale on AWS. HPC instances are ideal for applications that benefit from high-performance
            processors such as large, complex simulations and deep learning workloads.

    Security groups
        - are the fundamental of network security in AWS
        - they control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances
        - security groups only contain allow rules !!!!!

        - they act as a firewall on our EC2 instances
        - one security group can be attached to multiple EC2 instances, and one EC2 instance can also have multiple
        security groups
        - all inbound traffic is BLOCKED by default
        - all outbound traffic is ALLOWED by default

        Dan: see "05- security groups diagram.png"

    Classic ports to know
        - 22 = SSH (secure shell) - log into linux instance
        - 21 = FTP - upload files
        - 22 = SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) - upload files using SSH
        - 80 = HTTP - access unsecure websites
        - 443 = HTTPS - access secure websites
        - 3389 = RDP (remote desktop protocol) - log into a Windows instance

        http://13.60.59.239/

    SSH to EC2 instance
        ssh -i EC2-Tutorial.pem ec2-user@ec2-13-60-59-239.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com
            - you need to run this command from the secrets folder where the EC2-Tutorial.pem file contains a private key,
            that was either generated or selected during instance creation
            - ec2-user is  user created for linux that is running on the instance

        sudo -s (to become root)

!!! You should assign a role to the EC2 instance, by selecting the instance and going to Actions -> Security -> Modify IAM role.
    After doing the above step if you look into the EC2 instance settings ,in the Security tab you should see the IAM role.
    If you assign a role like "DemoRoleForEC2" that has "IAMReadOnlyAccess" permission, then in the ssh console you can
    run something like
        "aws iam list-users"

!!! Which purchasing option is better for me ?      (using a resort as an analogy for EC2)
        - On demand : coming and staying in a resort, whenever we like, we pay the full price.
        - Reserved : like planning ahead, and if we plan to stay for a long time (1-3 years), we may get a good discount
        - Savings plan : pay a certain amount per hour for certain period and stay in any room type(eg King Suite, Sea View)
        - Spot instances: the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms. You can
            get kicked out at any time. (so this is for jobs/processes that can handle being killed any time)
        - Dedicated hosts: we book an entire building of the resort
        - capacity reservations : you book a room for a period with full price, even if you do not stay in it

        Dan: see "5-2 price comparison.png"

06 EC2 Instance Storage

    EBS Volume
     - means "elastic block store" is a network drive that you can attach to your instances while they run
     - allows you to persist instance data, even after their termination; this means that one can terminante an instance
     and after some time start a new instance, with the same EBS volume and have access to the same data that the previous
     EC2 instance had
     - an EBS can be mounted only for one EC2 instance at a time; however one EC2 instance can have multiple EBS volumes
     - they are bound to availability zones
     - think of them as a network USB stick !!!
     - the connection between EBS and EC2 is via a network which means that latency can occur
!!!  - when you create an EBS it has a flag "Delete on termination" ...which if set to true, when the EC2 is terminated,
        will be deleted
      - EBS snapshots are a backup of of your EBS volume at a moment in time
      - you can copy EBS snapshots across availability zones or regions
      - EBS snapshot archive is a storage that is 75% cheaper...but this means that it will take betweem 24 an 72 hours to
      retrieve that archive...so cheaper means slower :)
      - there is also a Recycle Bin feature for which you can set up rules as in how many days to keep there a delete snapshot,
      this is obviously useful in cases of accidental deletion

    AMI
        - amazon machine image
        - customization of an EC2 instance...you add your own software, configuration, operating system etc
        - this provides faster boot time because all your software is pre-packaged
        - are built for a specific region, and then they can be copied across regions
        - we can make and maintain our own AMI; you would create an EC2 instance, customize it how you want, then when
        ready, you stop it to maintain data integrity. Then you can build the AMI (this will also create EBS snapshots) and
        finally you can use that custom AMI
        - or you can buy AMIs from the marketplace

    EC2 image builder
        - used to automate the creation of Virtual machines or container images
        => automate the creation, maintain, validate and test EC2 AMIs
        - can be run on a schedule
        - the output of a builder can be an AMI or a Docker image
            Dan: mi-a dat eroare cand am urmat pasiii...aparent instanta de EC2 care ar fi trebuit sa ruleze procesul de
            creare al imaginii avea probleme...pe care nu am mai stat sa le identific..
        - cu DanPipe2 am reusit sa fac AMI... practic am lasat default la un pasul unde e "Create infrastructure
        configuration using service defaults" ...asta foloseste un EC2 instance care costa bani ...insa ideea e sa opresc
        EC2 dupa ce termina de creat imaginea

    EC2 Instance store
        - if you need high performance hard disk you must use EC2 instance store
        - better I/O performance
        - EC2 instance store lose their storage data if they are stopped...so this is suited for buffer / cache/ temporary
        data
        - for long term storage EBS is the choice

    EFS - Elastic file system
        - this is a managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2 instances at a time, even if
        these EC2s are located in multiple availability zones
        - works with linux instances
        - a variant of this is EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA) , which is a storage class that is optimized for files not accessed
        every day (up to 92% lower costs)
        - EFS can be configured to automatically move files to EFS-IA after a certain period of time since they were last
        accessed

    Amazon FSx
        - use 3rd party high performance file systems on AWS (in case you do not like the offered storage options from
        AWS...or you want to store some data on your servers instead of Amazons for various reasons)
        -  Amazon FSx for windows file server
        -  Amazon FSx for Lustre (name is derived from "Linux" and "cluster")


==============================================================================================================
07 ELB & ASG - Elastic Load Balancing & Auto Scaling Groups

    - Vertical scalability means increasing the size of the instance...imagine a call center...and a Junior employee,
    vertical scaling would mean to replace him with a senior employee when there are too many calls
        so go from t3.micro to t3.large instance
    - there is a limit on how much you can scale this way : the hardware

    - Horizontal scalability ...means increasing the number of instances ...so in the call center example, this means
    adding more employees based on demand

    - High availability goes hand in hand with Horizontal scalability...and it means that your system runs in at least
    2 availability zones...in the call center example it means to have a call center in New York and another one in London

    - a load balancer is a server that forwards internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 instances). By using one you can
    expose a single point of access (DNS) for your application
    - the load balancer will not direct traffic to a failling instance, because it performs regular health checks
    - you can use a load balancer across multiple availability zones

    - ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) is a managed load balancer...AWS guarantees that it will be working and takes care of
    upgrades, maintenance etc
    - AWS offers 3 kinds of ELBs:
        1. application load balancer (HTTP/HTTPS only)
        2. network load balancer (allows TCP...maybe for gaming, offer higher performance)
        3. classic load balancer (this offering is being retired by Amazon)

    Dan: see "AWS Load Balancer to 2 EC2 instances .png" to understand the elements needed to be configured for a load
        balancer...there is a youtube video about this below as well..

    - Auto Scaling groups are collections of Amazon EC2 instances that enable automatic scaling and fleet
    management features. These features help you maintain the health and availability of your applications.
    - you can choose various metrics, like CPU usage, and once the running EC2 instances reach that CPU usage threshold,
    new EC2 instances are created.
    - these new instances are added to the Target Group that is configured for the Load Balancer..

TODO Continu with 08 S3

TODO Whenever you run into a problem with the course, maybe you can try and look over the videos of this other course:
